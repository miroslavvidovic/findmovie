# Contributing to findmovie

Contributing to this project is welcomed in any form possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## All code changes happen through pull requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). Pull requests are actively welcomed:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/miroslavvidovic/findmovie/issues)

This project uses GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- Be specific!
- Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* use [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) to check your code

## License

Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License. In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](LICENSE.md) that covers the project.
